## XML File ##

Among the operators for XML file, we have :

- Node with child nodes
- Node with attributes
- Add/Collect attributes
- Create/Load file
- Catch file

Note that if an object contains other objects, the code generator assumes that the methods **Node with child nodes**, **Node with attributes** or **Add/Collect attributes** have been generated by **Dev-Object** for these objects.
