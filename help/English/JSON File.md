## JSON File ##

Among the operators for JSON file, we have :

- Insert/Extract object
- SaveOn/LoadFrom file
- Catch file

Note that if an object contains other objects, the code generator assumes that the methods **Insert/Extract object** have been generated by **Dev-Object** for these objects.

## Limitations ##

Dynamic multi-dimensional arrays of objects are not supported at this time.
