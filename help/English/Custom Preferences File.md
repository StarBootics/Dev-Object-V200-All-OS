## Custom Preferences File ##

Among the operators for custom preferences file, we have :

- Add/Extract a group
- Refresh a group 
- SaveOn/LoadFrom a file

## IMPORTANT ##

The code generator uses a non-compiled **OOP** style user library to manage the data. See the source code of that library (**CustomPrefs - OOP.pb**) in the installation folder of Dev-Object, sub-folder **custom libs**.

Note that if an object contains other objects, the operators **Add/Extract a group** and also the **Refresh a group** must be modified manually.
