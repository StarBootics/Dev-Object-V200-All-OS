## Maths Operators ##

Among the operators for mathematic, we have :

- Equal
- Plus
- Minus
- Add
- AddScaled
- Substract
- Product
- Divide
- AddScalar
- SubstractScalar
- ProductByScalar
- DivideByScalar
- Lerp

Note that all these operators work only if the object contains only simple fields. That is to say, no fields of dynamic table type, of chained list type, of map type or of static array type.

The operators **Plus**, **Minus**, **Product**, **Divide** and **Lerp** will create new objects. So be careful not to create memory leaks while using them.
