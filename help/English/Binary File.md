## Binary File ##

Among the operators for binary file, we have :

- Read/Write on file
- Create file
- Open file
- Read file

Note that if an object contains other objects, the code generator takes for granted that the **Read/Write** methods were generated by **Dev-Object** for these objects.

Note for the **Create**, **Open** and **Read** file, it is possible to add the writing or reading of a **FileFormatID** to make sure that file format is what we expect to have.

See the help about **FileFormatID** library.
