## Encoded or Encrypted File ##

Among the operators for encoded or encrypted file, we have :

- Read/Write on file
- Create file
- Open file
- Read file

## IMPORTANT ##

The code generator uses non-compiled **OOP** style user libraries to encode or encrypt data. See the examples of libraries supplied with **Dev-Object** to understand how to create a library yourself that can be used by the code generator.

Note that if an object contains other objects, the code generator takes for granted that the **Read/Write** methods were generated by **Dev-Object** for these objects.

Note for the **Create**, **Open** and **Read** file, it is possible to add the writing or reading of a **FileFormatID** to make sure that file format is what we expect to have. The **FileFormatID** is not encoded or encrypted in the file.

See the help about **FileFormatID** library.
