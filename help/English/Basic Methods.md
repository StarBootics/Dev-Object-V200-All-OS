## Basic Methods ##

Among the basic methods, we have : 

- The Getter(s)
- The Setter(s)
- Update
- Reset
- Clear
- Access

Limitations of the **Update** method: works only if the object contains only simple fields. That is to say, no fields of dynamic array type, of linked list type, of map type or of static array type.

Note about the **Reset** and **Clear** methods: These two methods have the same internal code. Only the name of the method differs.

Note about the **Access** method: This method is very specific and has no interest apart from offering access to the object's data. This method is necessary in order to be able to pass the data to OpenGL functions for example.
